[tracing-timing](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-timing/0.2.8) also collects latency information for code instrumented with the [tracing](https://crates.io/crates/tracing) library, using histograms from [hdrhistogram](https://crates.io/crates/hdrhistogram). _tracing-timing_ collects latencies for [events](https://docs.rs/tracing/0.1.37/tracing/#events) within [spans](https://docs.rs/tracing/0.1.37/tracing/#spans). This provides more flexibility but also requires events to be defined within spans in order to measure latencies. Interpreting the latency results associated with events can be challenging for async code. By contrast, this framework simply measures span latencies and ignores events.

I am grateful to the author of _tracing-timing_ for creating a high-quality, well-documented library which introduced me to the _hdrhistogram_ crate and provided key insights into latency tracing concepts and mechanisms.
